/**
 *
 * Finds the shortest distance between two nodes in a graph with non-negative
 * weights. It starts by setting the start node's distance to 0 and all
 * others to infinity. Then it uses a priority queue to always pick the
 * node with the smallest current distance. For each node it picks,
 * it goes through all its neighbors and if going through the current
 * node gives a shorter path to a neighbor, it updates that neighborâ€™s
 * distance and stores the current node in the prev list to remember
 * the path. It then pushes that neighbor into the queue to check it later.
 * This continues untill the queue is empty or the goal is reached.
 * The shortest path is then guranteed since function always checks the
 * cheapest options first.
 *
 * Time complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of nodes and E is
 * the number of edges. This is because each node is popped from the queue once,
 * taking O(log V) time per pop and each edge leads to at most one push into the
 * queue also requiring O(log V) per operation.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(V) because of the storage of distance values for each node
 * and the priority queue which may have up to V elements at once.
 *
 * @returns A vector of distances from start to each other reachable node and a
 * prev vector that stores the previous node on the shortest path to each node.
