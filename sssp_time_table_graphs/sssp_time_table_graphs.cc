/**
 *
 * Finds the shortest distance from the start node to all other nodes in a graph
 * where edges can only be used at certain times. It starts by setting the start
 * node's time to 0 and all others to infinity. Then it uses a priority queue to
 * always pick the node we can reach the soonest. For each edge from the current
 * node, it uses the next_departure function to check when is the next allowed
 * time to take that edge (can be now or after some wait). If taking that edge
 * gives a faster arrival time at the destination node, it updates that node’s
 * time and stores the current node in the prev vector to remember
 * the path. It then pushes that neighbor into the queue to check it later.
 * This continues until the queue is empty and we have found the shortest arrival
 * time for all reachable nodes.
 *
 * The fastest path is guaranteed since the function always checks the
 * fastest known arrival times first and only updates a node’s time if a quicker
 * route is found so no faster path to a node can be missed.
 *
 * Time complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of nodes and E is
 * the number of edges. This is because each node is popped from the queue once,
 * taking O(log V) time per pop and each edge leads to at most one push into the
 * queue also requiring O(log V) per operation.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(V) because of the storage of distance values for each node
 * and the priority queue which may have up to V elements at once.
 *
 * @returns A vector of shortest times from start to each other reachable node
 * and a prev vector that stores the previous node on the shortest time path to
 * each node.
