/**
 *
 * Finds the shortest path from a node to all other nodes in a graph where edge
 * weights may be negative. It starts by setting the start node's distance to 0
 * and all others to infinity. Then, it loops through the graph nodes-1 times
 * which is enough to find the shortest paths given that there is no negative
 * cycles. In each iteration, it goes through each edge and checks if going
 * through the current edge would give a shorter path to the destination node. If
 * so, it updates that nodes distance and stores current node in the prev vector
 * to remember the path for later. It's necessarry to go through the whole graph
 * again in each iteration because negative weights can cause changes that allows
 * for even shorter paths in later iterations but if no changes are made during
 * a full round, the loop ends early since it means that all distances are
 * already set.
 *
 * After the first loop, it has one more loop through all edges to check for any
 * that can still be relaxed. If such an edge exists, it means thereâ€™s a negative
 * weight cycle in the graph that can be reached from the start node. Nodes
 * affected by these cycles are marked (-INF) to show that their distances are
 * not defined. Other nodes that can be reached from those should also be marked
 * since it's possible to keep decrasing their distances by looping through
 * the cycle. This is handeled in a third loop that spreads the -INF value
 * outward from the nodes in the second loop.
 *
 *
 * Time complexity: O(V * E) Where V is the number of nodes and E is the number
 * of edges. This is because in the worst case, the function needs to go through
 * all edges up to V - 1 times to find the correct shortest paths, and then again
 * to check for negative cycles and to propagate their effect.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(V) for storing distances, prevs, and negative cycle flags.
 *
 * @returns A vector of distances from start to each other reachable node and a
 * prev vector that stores the previous node on the shortest path to each node.
